# Vertebot

A brain-based device or 'neurorobot' is a machine with a control system that resembles a biological brain. This repo and the [website](http://www.vertebot.com/) provide instructions, discussion and code for building a neurorobot. The long-term aim is to develop a robot with an artificial vertebrate brain: a 'vertebot'.
